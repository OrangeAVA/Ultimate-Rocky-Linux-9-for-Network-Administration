AWS User Management and Security Setup
This document provides an overview of best practices and detailed steps for implementing user management, roles, policies, MFA, and auditing in AWS. The following sections cover the IAM role definitions, policies, MFA enforcement, and the setup of AWS CloudTrail, with an emphasis on security best practices and auditing.
IAM Role Definitions
The IAM roles for Developer-Staging and Developer-Prod are defined with specific permissions to ensure access control and security. Below are the refined IAM role definitions:
For Developer-Staging role:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
For Developer-Prod role (with restricted access to production resources):
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "ec2:TerminateInstances",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
MFA Enforcement Policy
To ensure enhanced security, a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) policy is enforced. This policy denies all actions unless MFA is enabled for the user:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "*",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
      "Bool": {
        "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
AWS CloudTrail Setup
AWS CloudTrail is used to log and audit user activity in AWS. Below are the setup steps:
1. Go to the CloudTrail Console.
2. Click on 'Create Trail'.
3. Name the trail (e.g., 'DeveloperActivityTrail').
4. Select 'All regions' for logging.
5. Store logs in an S3 bucket with proper permissions.
6. Enable integration with CloudWatch Logs for real-time alerts.
This setup ensures that user actions are tracked for auditing and compliance purposes.
Conclusion and Best Practices
Implementing the right IAM roles, policies, and MFA enforcement in AWS is critical to securing cloud resources and ensuring compliance. Regular auditing with CloudTrail ensures that all user activities are tracked and any suspicious actions can be investigated. By following these guidelines, organizations can enforce strict access controls, enhance security, and maintain proper compliance with regulations.
